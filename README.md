# What is KNN Algorithm?
K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is one of the simplest algorithms used in Machine Learning for regression and classification.\
KNN uses all the available data and classifies the new data or case based on a similarity measure (distance function).\
The new data is then assigned to the class which has the most nearest neighbors.

# How is KNN used?
The K in KNN stands for the number of nearest neighbors your are using to figure out how to assign a class for your new data.
KNN is used in situations where you want to find similar items. \
- KNN is used in recommendation systems such as finding products similar to what you are searching for or to make movie recommendations.
- Searching semantically similar documents, such as Google search.
- OCR, Image or Video Recognition

# How to make predictions using KNN algorithm?
KNN uses distance formulas to see where the data fits. Some distance formulas used are:
- Euclidean distance is the most commonly used distance formula when calculating KNN. Euclidean distance formula finds the shortest distance between points A and B.

- Another distance formula is the Manhattan distance formula. This formula finds the distance between point A and B measured along the  axis at right angles.
